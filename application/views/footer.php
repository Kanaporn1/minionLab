                    The Minions are small, yellow, cylindrical creatures, who have one or two eyes. They are the
                    signature characters of the Despicable Me series. They bring much of the comedy in the film, and
                    they are known as the scene-stealer of the movie. Frequently, they speak in an incomprehensible
                    language, called Minionese, occasionally switching to English. They are much childish in some ways,
                    yet they seem to be very intelligent in certain aspects.
